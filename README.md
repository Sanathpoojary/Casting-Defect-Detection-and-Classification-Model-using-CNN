# Casting-Defect-Detection-and-Classification-Model-using-CNN
A Machine learning model to detect defects in industrial pump impeller casts and classify the type of it.

**Abstract**

This work aims to develop a neural network to categorize the submersible pump impeller casts as defective or not. Nearly 7348 images of the casts provided by Pilot Technocast cast manufacturer are used. The model used here is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The activation function used is Relu. A two layered convolutional network is used with Conv2d and Maxpooling2d layers in it. This model is trained using the above dataset and is then used to classify new images with an accuracy of roughly 94%. This work also proposes a detect classification method which can identify the defect type.
